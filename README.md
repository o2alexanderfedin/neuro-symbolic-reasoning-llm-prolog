# Self-Explaining Symbolic Reasoning

**LLM-Generated Prolog Predicates with Embedded Justification Chains**

> A novel neuro-symbolic reasoning architecture where Large Language Models generate domain-specific Prolog predicates that embed reasoning justifications directly into their logic.

---

## 📄 Paper Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive academic research paper proposing a hybrid AI architecture that bridges the gap between neural language models and symbolic reasoning systems.

### Abstract

Large language models excel at semantic understanding but fail at logical reasoning. Symbolic systems like SMT solvers provide mathematical rigor but produce opaque proofs. We propose an architecture where LLMs generate domain-specific Prolog predicates that embed reasoning justifications directly into their logic structure, producing **semantic proof certificates in natural domain language**.

### Key Contributions

1. **Novel Architecture**: LLM generates both logic AND reasoning justifications in unified predicates
2. **Self-Documenting Predicates**: Intrinsic explainability vs post-hoc explanations
3. **Semantic Proof Certificates**: Domain language proofs, not formal calculi
4. **Domain Flexibility**: On-demand generation for arbitrary domains
5. **Rich Side Effects**: Automatic explanations, counterfactuals, and audit trails
6. **RAG-Based Template Libraries**: Sub-100ms inference with 20-60x speedup

### Key Results

- ✅ **97.5%** overall correctness across 365 benchmark problems
- ✅ **99.6%** agreement with SMT solvers
- ✅ **4.3/5** explainability score (vs 2.1/5 for SMT)
- ✅ **20-60x speedup** with RAG template caching
- ✅ **92%** user preference for our explanations
