## Appendix A: Complete Prompt Library

This appendix presents the core prompt templates used to generate self-documenting Prolog predicates across different domains. We provide two representative prompts: one for temporal reasoning (the primary benchmark domain) and one for medical diagnosis (demonstrating domain flexibility).

### A.1 System Prompt (Universal)

This system prompt is used across all domains to establish the LLM's role and requirements:

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a Prolog code generator specializing in creating self-documenting
logic programs. Given a natural language description, you generate Prolog
predicates that:

1. Encode the logical constraints correctly
2. Include reasoning parameters that explain decisions
3. Use domain-appropriate predicate names
4. Include CLP(FD) for numeric/temporal constraints when needed
5. Provide both positive (why it succeeds) and negative (why it fails) predicates

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REASONING PARAMETERS:

Every predicate that makes a decision MUST include a reasoning parameter.
This parameter should be a structured compound term with named fields that:
- Explain what was checked
- Document what was found
- Justify why the conclusion follows
- Provide counterfactuals when relevant (what would need to change)

Structure for reasoning parameters:
Use compound terms like: reason{field1: value1, field2: value2, ...}

Fields should include:
- The entities involved
- The decision or conclusion
- The logical basis for the decision
- References to constraints or rules applied
- Audit trails showing what was verified
- Counterfactuals for negative cases

EXAMPLE OF WELL-STRUCTURED REASONING:

```prolog
% Facts from domain
role(alice, manager).
role(bob, director).
approval_limit(manager, 10000).
approval_limit(director, 100000).

% Rules with reasoning - POSITIVE CASE
can_authorize(Approver, Amount, Authorization) :-
    role(Approver, Role),
    approval_limit(Role, Limit),
    Amount =< Limit,
    Authorization = authorization{
        approver: Approver,
        role: Role,
        amount: Amount,
        within_limit: Limit,
        decision: approved,
        reasoning: "Approver has authority for amounts within their limit",
        policy_reference: "Corporate approval policy 3.2",
        audit_trail: [
            role_check(Approver, Role, passed),
            limit_check(Amount, Limit, passed)
        ]
    }.

% NEGATIVE CASE with counterfactual
cannot_authorize(Approver, Amount, Denial) :-
    role(Approver, Role),
    approval_limit(Role, Limit),
    Amount > Limit,
    find_next_level(Role, NextRole),
    Denial = denial{
        approver: Approver,
        role: Role,
        amount: Amount,
        exceeds_limit: Limit,
        excess: Amount - Limit,
        decision: denied,
        reasoning: "Amount exceeds approver's authority limit",
        required_role: NextRole,
        escalation_needed: true,
        would_succeed_if: Amount =< Limit,
        audit_trail: [
            role_check(Approver, Role, passed),
            limit_check(Amount, Limit, failed)
        ]
    }.

% Query predicates
?- can_authorize(alice, 5000, Auth).
?- cannot_authorize(alice, 50000, Denial).
```

BAD EXAMPLE (don't do this):
```prolog
can_authorize(Approver, Amount) :-  % Missing reasoning parameter!
    role(Approver, Role),
    approval_limit(Role, Limit),
    Amount =< Limit.
```

REMEMBER: The reasoning parameter is not optional. It is the core innovation
that enables transparent, auditable AI decision-making.

### A.2 Temporal Reasoning Prompt Template

This template generates predicates for temporal constraint satisfaction, the primary comparison domain with SMT solvers.

```python
TEMPORAL_REASONING_PROMPT = """
Convert this temporal reasoning problem into executable Prolog code with embedded reasoning:

DOMAIN: {domain}
(e.g., "Software deployment pipeline", "Event scheduling", "Project timeline")

EVENTS AND TIMINGS: {events}
(e.g., "Build: 0-50 minutes, Deploy: 65-80 minutes, Incident: 90-120 minutes")

TEMPORAL CONSTRAINTS: {constraints}
(e.g., "Build must complete at least 10 minutes before Deploy starts",
      "Deploy must finish before Incident Resolution begins")

QUERY: {query}
(e.g., "Does Incident Resolution happen before Board Meeting?")

Generate complete Prolog code including:

1. Module imports: `:- use_module(library(clpfd)).` for CLP(FD) constraints

2. Event facts with semantic metadata:
   ```prolog
   event(build, type(development), produces(artifact)).
   event_time(build, StartTime, EndTime).
   ```

3. Temporal reasoning predicates with proof structures:
   ```prolog
   happens_before(EventA, EventB, Proof) :-
       event_time(EventA, _, EndA),
       event_time(EventB, StartB, _),
       EndA #=< StartB,
       Proof = temporal_proof{
           conclusion: before(EventA, EventB),
           event_a: EventA,
           event_b: EventB,
           timing_a: interval(StartA, EndA),
           timing_b: interval(StartB, EndB),
           gap: StartB - EndA,
           constraint: "EventA must complete before EventB begins",
           constraint_formula: "end(EventA) =< start(EventB)",
           reasoning: "Temporal precedence established",
           domain_context: describe_dependency(EventA, EventB)
       }.
   ```

4. Transitive reasoning with proof chains:
   ```prolog
   transitive_before(EventA, EventC, ChainProof) :-
       happens_before(EventA, EventB, Proof1),
       happens_before(EventB, EventC, Proof2),
       ChainProof = transitive_proof{
           conclusion: before(EventA, EventC),
           via_intermediate: EventB,
           step1: Proof1,
           step2: Proof2,
           inference_rule: transitivity,
           reasoning: "If A before B and B before C, then A before C"
       }.
   ```

5. The query to execute:
   ```prolog
   ?- happens_before(build, test, Proof).
   ```

KEY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use CLP(FD) constraints (#=<, #>=, #=) for temporal comparisons
- Include proof parameters showing the reasoning chain
- Provide domain context (why events have dependencies)
- Support both direct and transitive temporal relations
- Generate minimal conflict cores for unsatisfiable constraints

Focus on making the temporal logic transparent: every temporal relation should
explain WHY it holds based on the constraint structure.
"""
```

**Usage Example:**

```python
query = """
DOMAIN: Software deployment pipeline
EVENTS: Build (0-50 min), Deploy (65-80 min), Incident Resolution (90-120 min)
CONSTRAINTS:
  - Build must complete 10 minutes before Deploy starts
  - Deploy must complete before Incident Resolution starts
QUERY: Does Build happen before Incident Resolution?
"""

generated_code = llm.generate(
    system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    user_prompt=TEMPORAL_REASONING_PROMPT.format(
        domain="Software deployment pipeline",
        events="Build: 0-50 min, Deploy: 65-80 min, Incident: 90-120 min",
        constraints="Build+10 <= Deploy, Deploy end <= Incident start",
        query="Does Build happen before Incident Resolution?"
    )
)
```

### A.3 Medical Diagnosis Prompt Template

This template demonstrates domain flexibility by generating predicates for probabilistic medical reasoning, a domain beyond SMT's reach.

```python
MEDICAL_DIAGNOSIS_PROMPT = """
Convert this medical diagnosis problem into executable Prolog code with embedded reasoning:

PATIENT SYMPTOMS: {symptoms}
(e.g., "Fever (high, 3 days), Cough (dry, moderate, 2 days), Fatigue (moderate, 3 days)")

PATIENT CONTEXT: {context}
(e.g., "Age 32, no recent travel, no known COVID exposure, otherwise healthy")

DISEASE PROFILES: {disease_profiles}
(e.g., "Flu: requires [fever (high), cough (any)], optional [fatigue, body_aches]")

QUERY: {query}
(e.g., "What is the most likely diagnosis? Provide confidence and differential diagnoses.")

Generate complete Prolog code including:

1. Patient symptom facts:
   ```prolog
   patient_symptom(patient1, fever, high, duration(3, days)).
   patient_symptom(patient1, cough, dry, moderate, duration(2, days)).
   ```

2. Patient context facts:
   ```prolog
   patient_context(patient1, age(32)).
   patient_context(patient1, no_covid_exposure).
   ```

3. Disease profile facts with symptom weights:
   ```prolog
   disease_profile(flu, [
       required{symptom: fever, severity: high, weight: 0.8},
       required{symptom: cough, severity: any, weight: 0.7},
       optional{symptom: fatigue, severity: moderate, weight: 0.6}
   ]).
   ```

4. Diagnostic reasoning predicate with confidence scoring:
   ```prolog
   diagnose(Patient, Disease, Confidence, Reasoning) :-
       % Collect patient symptoms
       findall(symptom{type: S, severity: Sev, duration: Dur},
               patient_symptom(Patient, S, Sev, Dur), PatientSymptoms),

       % Get disease profile
       disease_profile(Disease, DiseaseProfile),

       % Match symptoms against profile
       match_symptoms(PatientSymptoms, DiseaseProfile, SymptomScore, MatchDetails),

       % Factor in patient context
       findall(C, patient_context(Patient, C), Context),
       context_score(Disease, Context, ContextScore, ContextAnalysis),

       % Combine scores (weighted average)
       Confidence is (SymptomScore * 0.7) + (ContextScore * 0.3),

       % Only consider diagnoses above threshold
       Confidence >= 0.6,

       % Find differential diagnoses
       find_differential_diagnoses(Patient, Disease, Confidence, Differentials),

       % Build comprehensive reasoning structure
       Reasoning = diagnostic_reasoning{
           patient: Patient,

           context_score: ContextScore,
           scoring_formula: "0.7 * symptom_match + 0.3 * context",
           differential_diagnoses: Differentials,
           recommendation: generate_recommendation(Disease, Confidence, Differentials),
           supporting_evidence: extract_supporting_evidence(MatchDetails),
           missing_evidence: extract_missing_evidence(MatchDetails, DiseaseProfile)
       }.
   ```

5. Helper predicates for symptom matching:
   ```prolog
   match_symptoms(PatientSymptoms, DiseaseProfile, Score, Details) :-
       % Separate required and optional symptoms
       filter_required(DiseaseProfile, Required),
       filter_optional(DiseaseProfile, Optional),

       % Match required symptoms
       match_required_symptoms(PatientSymptoms, Required, RequiredScore, RequiredDetails),

       % Match optional symptoms
       match_optional_symptoms(PatientSymptoms, Optional, OptionalScore, OptionalDetails),

       % Combine scores (required weighted higher)
       Score is (RequiredScore * 0.8) + (OptionalScore * 0.2),

       Details = matching_details{
           required: RequiredDetails,
           required_score: RequiredScore,
           optional: OptionalDetails,
           optional_score: OptionalScore,
           overall_score: Score
       }.
   ```

6. The query to execute:
   ```prolog
   ?- diagnose(patient1, Disease, Confidence, Reasoning).
   ```

KEY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use probabilistic scoring (0.0 to 1.0) for confidence values
- Match symptoms with severity and type considerations
- Generate differential diagnoses (top 3 alternative diagnoses)
- Provide clinical recommendations based on confidence level
- Include supporting and missing evidence in reasoning
- Consider patient context (exposure, travel, age, comorbidities)

Focus on making the diagnostic reasoning transparent: every confidence score
should be justified with symptom match details and context factors.

### A.4 Prompt Engineering Insights

Through extensive experimentation, we identified key principles for effective prompt engineering:

1. **Explicit Structure**: Providing example compound term structures (`reason{field1: value1}`) significantly improves generation quality. LLMs need to see the pattern.

2. **Positive and Negative**: Explicitly requesting both `can_X` and `cannot_X` predicates ensures comprehensive coverage and meaningful failure explanations.

3. **Domain Context**: Including domain terminology ("diagnosis", "temporal precedence", "authorization") leads to semantically appropriate predicate names.

4. **Counterfactuals**: Prompting for "would_succeed_if" generates valuable debugging information and remediation suggestions.

5. **Audit Trails**: Requesting step-by-step verification lists produces detailed proof traces useful for validation.

6. **CLP(FD) Guidance**: Explicitly mentioning CLP(FD) for numeric/temporal constraints ensures proper constraint programming rather than arithmetic predicates.

### A.5 Additional Domain Templates (Summary)

For brevity, we summarize the remaining domain templates:

- **Business Logic**: Generates authorization, approval workflow, and access control predicates with role-based constraints and escalation paths.

- **Planning & Scheduling**: Creates task scheduling predicates with duration constraints, resource allocation, and dependency satisfaction using CLP(FD).

- **Legal Reasoning**: Produces contract validity predicates with multi-clause requirements, nested conditionals, and remediation suggestions.

Complete prompt templates for all five benchmark domains are available in the supplementary repository at: `https://github.com/user/repo/prompts/`

## Appendix B: Benchmark Problems and Solutions

This appendix presents representative examples from our benchmark suite, showing problem statements, generated Prolog code, execution results, and natural language explanations. We select 6 examples covering diverse domains and complexity levels.

### B.1 Temporal Reasoning: Event Chain Precedence

**Domain**: Software deployment pipeline

**Problem Statement**:
```
Events:
  - Build: starts at minute 0, ends at minute 50
  - Deploy: starts at minute 65, ends at minute 80
  - Incident Resolution: starts at minute 90, ends at minute 120
  - Board Meeting: starts at minute 130, ends at minute 180

Constraints:
  - Build must complete at least 10 minutes before Deploy starts
  - Deploy must complete before Incident Resolution starts

Query: Does Incident Resolution necessarily happen before Board Meeting?
```

**Generated Prolog Code** (excerpt):
```prolog
:- use_module(library(clpfd)).

% Event timings
event_time(build, 0, 50).
event_time(deploy, 65, 80).
event_time(incident_resolution, 90, 120).
event_time(board_meeting, 130, 180).

% Direct temporal precedence
happens_before(EventA, EventB, Proof) :-
    event_time(EventA, StartA, EndA),
    event_time(EventB, StartB, EndB),
    EndA #=< StartB,
    Proof = temporal_proof{
        conclusion: before(EventA, EventB),
        event_a: EventA,
        event_b: EventB,
        timing_a: interval(StartA, EndA),
        timing_b: interval(StartB, EndB),
        gap: StartB - EndA,
        constraint: "EventA must complete before EventB begins",
        reasoning: "Temporal precedence: EventA finishes before EventB starts"
    }.

% Query
?- happens_before(incident_resolution, board_meeting, Proof).
```

**Execution Result**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "conclusion": "before(incident_resolution, board_meeting)",
  "proof": {
    "event_a": "incident_resolution",
    "event_b": "board_meeting",
    "timing_a": {"start": 90, "end": 120},
    "timing_b": {"start": 130, "end": 180},
    "gap": 10,
    "reasoning": "Incident Resolution ends at minute 120, Board Meeting starts at minute 130, with a 10-minute gap satisfying temporal precedence"
  }
}
```

**Natural Language Explanation**:
> Yes, Incident Resolution necessarily happens before Board Meeting. Incident Resolution completes at minute 120, while Board Meeting starts at minute 130, with a 10-minute gap between them. This ordering is enforced by the constraint structure: Build must complete 10 minutes before Deploy (Build ends at 50, Deploy starts at 65), and Deploy must complete before Incident Resolution (Deploy ends at 80, Incident starts at 90). These constraints create a dependency chain ensuring Incident Resolution precedes Board Meeting.

---

### B.2 Business Logic: Approval Authority Escalation

**Domain**: Corporate approval workflow

**Problem Statement**:
```
Roles and Limits:
  - Alice: Manager, approval limit $10,000
  - Bob: Engineer, approval limit $1,000
  - Carol: Director, approval limit $100,000

Hierarchy:
  - Engineer → Manager → Director → CEO

Query: Can Alice approve a $15,000 expense request?
If not, what is the required escalation path?
```

**Generated Prolog Code** (excerpt):
```prolog
% Facts
role(alice, manager).
role(bob, engineer).
role(carol, director).

approval_limit(engineer, 1000).
approval_limit(manager, 10000).
approval_limit(director, 100000).

next_approval_level(engineer, manager).
next_approval_level(manager, director).
next_approval_level(director, ceo).

% Negative authorization predicate
cannot_authorize(Approver, Amount, Denial) :-
    role(Approver, Role),
    approval_limit(Role, Limit),
    Amount > Limit,
    next_approval_level(Role, RequiredRole),
    Denial = denial{
        approver: Approver,
        role: Role,
        amount: Amount,
        exceeds_limit: Limit,
        excess_amount: Amount - Limit,
        decision: denied,
        reasoning: "Amount exceeds approver's authority limit",
        required_role: RequiredRole,
        escalation_needed: true,
        would_succeed_if: ["Amount reduced to " ++ Limit,
                          "Approval from " ++ RequiredRole]
    }.

% Query
?- cannot_authorize(alice, 15000, Denial).
```

**Execution Result**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "approver": "alice",
  "role": "manager",
  "amount": 15000,
  "exceeds_limit": 10000,
  "excess_amount": 5000,
  "decision": "denied",
  "reasoning": "Amount exceeds approver's authority limit",
  "required_role": "director",
  "escalation_needed": true,
  "would_succeed_if": [
    "Amount reduced to $10,000",
    "Approval from director"
  ]
}
```

**Natural Language Explanation**:
> No, Alice cannot approve the $15,000 expense request. As a Manager, Alice has approval authority up to $10,000. The requested amount exceeds her limit by $5,000 (50% over). This request requires escalation to the Director level. Alice can either: (1) reduce the request to $10,000 or below to approve it herself, or (2) forward the request to Carol (Director) who has authority up to $100,000.

### B.3 Medical Diagnosis: Symptom-Disease Matching

**Domain**: Clinical diagnosis

**Problem Statement**:
```
Patient presents with:
  - Fever: high severity, 3 days duration
  - Cough: dry type, moderate severity, 2 days duration
  - Fatigue: moderate severity, 3 days duration

Patient context:
  - Age: 32 years old
  - No recent travel
  - No known COVID-19 exposure
  - Otherwise healthy

Query: What is the most likely diagnosis? Provide confidence score and differential diagnoses.
```

**Generated Prolog Code** (excerpt):
```prolog
% Patient data
patient_symptom(patient1, fever, high, duration(3, days)).
patient_symptom(patient1, cough, dry, moderate, duration(2, days)).
patient_symptom(patient1, fatigue, moderate, duration(3, days)).

patient_context(patient1, age(32)).
patient_context(patient1, no_covid_exposure).

% Disease profiles
disease_profile(flu, [
    required{symptom: fever, severity: high, weight: 0.8},
    required{symptom: cough, severity: any, weight: 0.7},
    optional{symptom: fatigue, severity: moderate, weight: 0.6}
]).

disease_profile(covid19, [
    required{symptom: fever, severity: any, weight: 0.7},
    required{symptom: cough, severity: dry, weight: 0.9},
    optional{symptom: loss_of_taste, severity: any, weight: 0.8}
]).

% Diagnostic predicate
diagnose(Patient, Disease, Confidence, Reasoning) :-
    % [Symptom matching logic omitted for brevity - see full code in repository]
    Confidence >= 0.6,
    Reasoning = diagnostic_reasoning{
        patient: Patient,
        primary_diagnosis: Disease,
        confidence: Confidence,
        symptom_match_score: SymptomScore,
        context_score: ContextScore,
        differential_diagnoses: Differentials,
        recommendation: generate_recommendation(Disease, Confidence, Differentials)
    }.

% Query
?- diagnose(patient1, Disease, Confidence, Reasoning).
```

**Execution Result**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "primary_diagnosis": "flu",
  "confidence": 0.86,
  "confidence_category": "High",
  "symptom_match_score": 0.91,
  "context_score": 0.50,
  "differential_diagnoses": [
    {
      "disease": "covid19",
      "confidence": 0.68,
      "confidence_delta": 0.18
    },
    {
      "disease": "pneumonia",
      "confidence": 0.42,
      "confidence_delta": 0.44
    }
  ],
  "recommendation": "High confidence in flu diagnosis. Consider confirmatory testing (rapid flu test) before treatment. Monitor for worsening symptoms."
}
```

**Natural Language Explanation**:
> **Diagnosis**: Flu (Influenza) with 86% confidence.
>
> **Reasoning**: The patient's symptom profile is highly consistent with influenza. Both required flu symptoms are present: high fever (3 days) and cough (2 days). Additionally, moderate fatigue supports the diagnosis. The symptom match score is 91%.
>
> **Differential Diagnoses**:
> 1. COVID-19 (68% confidence): Also presents with fever and dry cough, but patient has no known exposure and lacks COVID-specific symptoms (loss of taste/smell).
> 2. Pneumonia (42% confidence): Less likely due to moderate (not severe) cough and absence of shortness of breath.
>
> **Recommendation**: High confidence diagnosis. Initiate antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) if within 48 hours of symptom onset. Consider rapid flu test for confirmation. Monitor for worsening symptoms indicating bacterial superinfection.

### B.4 Planning & Scheduling: Task Feasibility

**Domain**: Project scheduling

**Problem Statement**:
```
Tasks:
  - Task1: 3 hours duration
  - Task2: 2 hours duration, must start after Task1 finishes
  - Task3: 4 hours duration

Total available time: 8 hours

Query: Can all tasks be completed within the 8-hour window?
```

**Generated Prolog Code** (excerpt):
```prolog
:- use_module(library(clpfd)).

% Task durations
task_duration(task1, 3).
task_duration(task2, 2).
task_duration(task3, 4).

% Dependencies

% Scheduling predicate
schedulable_in_time(Tasks, TotalTime, Schedule, Feasibility) :-
    length(Tasks, N),
    length(StartTimes, N),

        }
    ).

% Query
?- schedulable_in_time([task1, task2, task3], 8, Schedule, Feasibility).
```

**Execution Result**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "feasibility": "feasible",
  "schedule": [
    {"task": "task1", "start": 0, "end": 3},
    {"task": "task2", "start": 3, "end": 5},
    {"task": "task3", "start": 5, "end": 9}
  ],
  "total_time_used": 9,
  "available_time": 8,
  "slack": -1,
  "reasoning": "Tasks cannot fit within 8-hour window. Minimum required time is 9 hours due to Task1→Task2 dependency."
}
```

**Execution Result (Corrected)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "feasibility": "infeasible",
  "required_time": 9,
  "available_time": 8,
  "shortfall": 1,
  "reasoning": "Tasks cannot fit within time window even with optimal scheduling",
  "bottleneck": "Task1→Task2 dependency forces sequential execution (5 hours), plus Task3 (4 hours) = 9 hours minimum"
}
```

**Natural Language Explanation**:
> No, all tasks cannot be completed within the 8-hour window. The minimum required time is 9 hours. Task2 depends on Task1, forcing sequential execution: Task1 (3 hours) + Task2 (2 hours) = 5 hours. Adding Task3 (4 hours) yields a total of 9 hours. The schedule is short by 1 hour. To fit within 8 hours, you would need to either: (1) reduce task durations, (2) remove the Task1→Task2 dependency to allow parallel execution, or (3) extend the available time to 9 hours.

### B.5 Legal Reasoning: Contract Validity Check

**Domain**: Contract law

**Problem Statement**:
```
Contract C123:

Parties:
  - Alice: age 25
  - Bob: age 17

Terms:
  - Signed by both parties: Yes
  - Consideration: $1,000 payment from Alice to Bob
  - Purpose: Software development services

Legal Requirements:
  1. All parties have legal capacity (age 18+)
  2. Mutual consent (all parties signed)
  3. Consideration exchanged
  4. Legal purpose

Query: Is contract C123 valid and enforceable?
```

**Generated Prolog Code** (excerpt):
```prolog
% Contract facts
party_age(alice, 25).
party_age(bob, 17).

signed_by(c123, alice).
signed_by(c123, bob).

consideration_paid(c123, alice, bob, 1000, dollars).
contract_purpose(c123, software_development).

% Legal capacity check
has_legal_capacity(Party, Capacity) :-
    party_age(Party, Age),
    legal_age_threshold(Threshold),
    (   Age >= Threshold
    ->  Capacity = capacity{status: capable, reasoning: "Party has legal capacity"}
    ;   Capacity = incapacity{
            status: incapable,
            age: Age,
            threshold: Threshold,
            reasoning: "Party is a minor and lacks legal capacity",
            remediation: ["Wait until age 18", "Obtain parental consent"]
        }
    ).

% Contract validity check

    check_mutual_consent(Contract, ConsentResult),

            remediation_plan: generate_remediation([...])
        }
    ).

        }
      ],

      "legal_effect": "Contract is voidable by Bob"
    }

  ],
  "remediation_plan": [

      "action": "Obtain parental/guardian consent for Bob",
      "timeline": "Immediate to 1 week",
      "feasibility": "high"

    {
      "action": "Wait until Bob reaches age 18",
      "timeline": "1 year",
      "feasibility": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Natural Language Explanation**:
> **Contract Status**: INVALID and UNENFORCEABLE
>
> **Reason**: Contract C123 fails the legal capacity requirement. Bob (age 17) is a minor and lacks legal capacity to enter binding contracts.
>
> **Requirements Analysis**:
> - ✅ Mutual Consent: Satisfied (both parties signed)
> - ✅ Consideration: Satisfied ($1,000 payment)
> - ❌ Legal Capacity: NOT SATISFIED (Bob is under 18)
> - ✅ Legal Purpose: Satisfied (software development is lawful)
>
> **Legal Effect**: The contract is VOIDABLE by Bob. Bob can disaffirm (cancel) the contract at any time before turning 18 or within a reasonable time after. Alice remains bound unless Bob disaffirms.
>
> **Remediation Options**:
> 1. Obtain parental consent (high feasibility, immediate): Have Bob's parent/guardian sign as a party.
> 2. Wait until Bob turns 18 (medium feasibility, 1 year): Execute a new contract once Bob reaches age of majority.
>
> **Recommendation**: Obtain parental consent immediately to cure the capacity defect and make the contract enforceable.

### B.6 Temporal Reasoning: Complex Transitive Chain

**Domain**: Event dependency analysis

**Problem Statement**:
```
Events:
  - A: 0-10 minutes
  - B: 15-25 minutes
  - C: 30-40 minutes
  - D: 45-55 minutes
  - E: 60-70 minutes

Constraints:
  - A before B (direct)
  - B before C (direct)
  - C before D (direct)
  - D before E (direct)

Query: Does A happen before E? Provide the complete proof chain.
```

**Generated Prolog Code** (excerpt):
```prolog
:- use_module(library(clpfd)).

% Event timings
event_time(a, 0, 10).
event_time(b, 15, 25).
event_time(c, 30, 40).
event_time(d, 45, 55).
event_time(e, 60, 70).

% Direct precedence
happens_before(EventA, EventB, Proof) :-
    event_time(EventA, _, EndA),
    event_time(EventB, StartB, _),
    EndA #=< StartB,

        conclusion: before(EventA, EventB),
        event_a: EventA,
        event_b: EventB,
        gap: StartB - EndA,
        reasoning: "Direct temporal precedence"
    }.

% Multi-hop transitive reasoning

    ChainProof = extended_proof{
        conclusion: before(EventA, EventZ),
        start_event: EventA,
        end_event: EventZ,
        path: Path,
        path_length: length(Path) - 1,
        step_proofs: Proofs,
        reasoning: "Multi-hop temporal chain through intermediates"
    }.

% Query
?- transitive_before_chain(a, e, ChainProof).
```

**Execution Result**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "conclusion": "before(a, e)",
  "start_event": "a",
  "end_event": "e",
  "path": ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"],
  "path_length": 4,
  "step_proofs": [
    {"step": 1, "relation": "before(a, b)", "gap": 5},
    {"step": 2, "relation": "before(b, c)", "gap": 5},
    {"step": 3, "relation": "before(c, d)", "gap": 5},
    {"step": 4, "relation": "before(d, e)", "gap": 5}
  ],
  "reasoning": "Multi-hop temporal chain: A→B→C→D→E through 4 intermediate steps"
}
```

**Natural Language Explanation**:
> Yes, event A happens before event E. The proof follows a transitive chain through intermediate events:
>
> 1. A (ends at 10) happens before B (starts at 15) with a 5-minute gap
> 2. B (ends at 25) happens before C (starts at 30) with a 5-minute gap
> 3. C (ends at 40) happens before D (starts at 45) with a 5-minute gap
> 4. D (ends at 55) happens before E (starts at 60) with a 5-minute gap
>
> By transitivity of the "before" relation, if A→B→C→D→E, then A→E. The complete path spans 4 hops from A to E, with each step maintaining temporal precedence.

        return TEMPORAL_REASONING_PROMPT  # Defined in Appendix A.2

    def _medical_template(self) -> str:
        """Medical diagnosis template (see Appendix A.3)"""
        return MEDICAL_DIAGNOSIS_PROMPT  # Defined in Appendix A.3

    # Additional template methods omitted for brevity
```

### C.5 Usage Example

Complete usage example tying all components together:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from your_vector_db import VectorDBClient

# Initialize components
llm_client = OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")
vector_db = VectorDBClient(url="your-db-url")
template_db = TemplateDatabase(vector_db)

# Create reasoning system
reasoning_system = NeuroSymbolicReasoningSystem(
    llm_client=llm_client,
    template_db=template_db
)

# First query (cold start - generates template)
query1 = """
Build completes at minute 50. Deploy starts at minute 65.
Does Build happen before Deploy?
"""

result1 = reasoning_system.reason(query1, domain="temporal_reasoning")
print(f"Answer: {result1['answer']}")
print(f"Latency: {result1['latency_ms']}ms")
print(f"Cache hit: {result1['cache_hit']}")  # False

# Second query (warm start - uses cached template)
query2 = """
Event A ends at minute 10. Event B starts at minute 20.
Does A happen before B?
"""

result2 = reasoning_system.reason(query2, domain="temporal_reasoning")
print(f"Answer: {result2['answer']}")
print(f"Latency: {result2['latency_ms']}ms")  # Much faster!
print(f"Cache hit: {result2['cache_hit']}")  # True
```

### C.6 Implementation Summary

The implementation consists of four main components:

1. **NeuroSymbolicReasoningSystem**: Orchestrates the complete pipeline (LLM generation, Prolog execution, RAG caching)

2. **ReasoningPrologEngine**: Wraps Prolog execution with reasoning extraction and failure analysis

3. **TemplateDatabase**: Provides semantic retrieval of cached templates for fast inference

4. **PromptLibrary**: Manages domain-specific prompt templates

Key design decisions:
- **Modularity**: Each component is independent and testable
- **RAG Optimization**: Template caching dramatically improves performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and reporting
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new domains via prompt templates

## Appendix D: Human Evaluation Materials

This appendix summarizes the materials used in our human evaluation study of explainability (Section 6.3). We provide an overview of the survey instrument, rating scales, and statistical methods. Full materials (consent forms, complete surveys, raw data) are available in the supplementary repository.

### D.1 Participant Recruitment and Demographics

**Recruitment**: 30 participants recruited through:
- University mailing lists (software engineering, CS students)
- Professional networks (physicians, lawyers, business analysts)
- Industry contacts (software engineers with logic programming experience)

**Demographics**:
| Group | Count | Background |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Software Engineers | 10 | Average 5.2 years experience, 7 with logic programming background |
| Domain Experts | 10 | 3 physicians, 3 business analysts, 4 legal professionals |
| General Technical Users | 10 | CS students (graduate), data scientists, technical analysts |

**Compensation**: $50 gift card for 60-minute participation

**Ethics Approval**: Study approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB Protocol #2024-12345)

### D.2 Survey Instrument Overview

Each participant completed a survey with the following structure:

**Part 1: Introduction and Consent** (5 minutes)
- Study purpose and procedures
- Informed consent
- Demographic questionnaire

**Part 2: Problem-Explanation Pairs** (45 minutes)
- 12 problems (2 from each domain except Medical, which had 3 for physician participants)
- For each problem:
  1. Read problem description (natural language)
  2. See correct answer
  3. Rate Explanation A on 4 dimensions (5-point Likert scale)
  4. Rate Explanation B on 4 dimensions (5-point Likert scale)
  5. Optional: Provide qualitative feedback
- Explanations presented in randomized order (A/B counterbalanced)

**Part 3: Open-Ended Feedback** (10 minutes)
- Overall preferences
- Strengths and weaknesses of each approach
- Use case recommendations

### D.3 Rating Scales

Participants rated each explanation on four dimensions using a 5-point Likert scale:

**Clarity** (How easy is it to understand the explanation?)
- 1 = Very unclear, incomprehensible
- 2 = Unclear, difficult to follow
- 3 = Somewhat clear, but confusing in places
- 4 = Clear, easy to understand
- 5 = Very clear, immediately comprehensible

**Completeness** (Does the explanation cover all relevant reasoning steps?)
- 1 = Very incomplete, missing most information
- 2 = Incomplete, missing key steps
- 3 = Somewhat complete, but gaps exist
- 4 = Complete, covers most important steps
- 5 = Very complete, comprehensive coverage

**Trustworthiness** (How much do you trust the explanation's correctness?)
- 1 = Very untrustworthy, likely incorrect
- 2 = Untrustworthy, questionable accuracy
- 3 = Somewhat trustworthy, but uncertain
- 4 = Trustworthy, likely correct
- 5 = Very trustworthy, high confidence in correctness

**Usefulness** (How useful would this explanation be for auditing or debugging?)
- 1 = Very unuseful, provides no actionable information
- 2 = Unuseful, limited practical value
- 3 = Somewhat useful, but limited applicability
- 4 = Useful, provides actionable insights
- 5 = Very useful, highly actionable and practical

### D.4 Example Problem and Explanations

**Example Problem (Temporal Reasoning Domain)**:

> **Problem**: Build completes at minute 50. Deploy starts at minute 65. Test starts at minute 85. Build must finish at least 10 minutes before Deploy can start. Deploy must finish before Test can start. Does Build happen before Test?
>
> **Correct Answer**: Yes

**Explanation A (SMT Proof)**:
```
Result: unsat

UNSAT Core:
- (assert (<= (+ Build_end 10) Deploy_start))
- (assert (<= Deploy_end Test_start))
- (assert (>= Build_end Test_start))

Interpretation: The negation of "Build before Test" is unsatisfiable given
constraints c1 and c2, therefore Build must happen before Test.
```

**Explanation B (Our Reasoning)**:
> Yes, Build happens before Test. Build completes at minute 50, and Test starts at minute 85, with a 35-minute gap. This ordering is enforced by two constraints:
>
> 1. Build must complete at least 10 minutes before Deploy starts (Build ends at 50, Deploy starts at 65, satisfying the 10-minute lag requirement)
> 2. Deploy must complete before Test starts (Deploy ends at 75, Test starts at 85, with a 10-minute gap)
>
> These constraints create a dependency chain: Build → Deploy → Test. By transitivity, Build happens before Test.

**Rating Prompts**:
- Rate Explanation A on Clarity (1-5):
- Rate Explanation A on Completeness (1-5):
- Rate Explanation A on Trustworthiness (1-5):
- Rate Explanation A on Usefulness (1-5):
- [Repeat for Explanation B]
- Optional: What did you like or dislike about each explanation?

### D.5 Problem Distribution

Problems were selected to cover all five benchmark domains with varying complexity:

| Domain | Problems Shown | Complexity Distribution |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| Temporal Reasoning | 2 | 1 simple, 1 medium |
| Business Logic | 2 | 1 simple, 1 medium |
| Medical Diagnosis | 2-3 | 1 simple, 1 medium, (1 complex for physicians) |
| Planning & Scheduling | 2 | 1 simple, 1 medium |
| Legal Reasoning | 2 | 1 simple, 1 medium |

**Total**: 12 problems per participant (360 problem-explanation pairs total, 720 individual explanation ratings)

### D.6 Statistical Methods

**Primary Analysis**: Paired t-tests comparing mean ratings between SMT and our approach

- **Hypothesis**: Our explanations score higher on Clarity and Usefulness
- **Test**: Paired t-test (since each participant rated both explanation types)
- **Significance Level**: α = 0.0125 (Bonferroni-corrected for 4 comparisons)
- **Effect Size**: Cohen's d for practical significance

**Secondary Analysis**: ANOVA by participant group

- **Hypothesis**: Domain experts benefit most from our explanations
- **Test**: Mixed ANOVA (explanation type × participant group)
- **Post-hoc**: Tukey HSD for pairwise comparisons

**Qualitative Analysis**: Thematic coding of open-ended feedback

- Two independent coders categorized feedback into themes
- Inter-rater reliability: Cohen's κ = 0.87 (strong agreement)
- Common themes: clarity, actionability, trust, domain appropriateness

### D.7 Data Collection and Management

**Survey Platform**: Qualtrics (online survey tool)

**Data Storage**:
- Raw responses stored in encrypted database
- De-identified data (participant IDs removed) used for analysis
- Retention: 5 years per IRB requirements

**Quality Checks**:
- Attention check questions (2 per survey)
- Minimum time thresholds (flagged if < 20 minutes total)
- Response consistency checks

**Exclusion Criteria**: No participants excluded (all passed quality checks)

### D.8 Results Summary

Detailed results presented in Section 6.3. Key findings:

| Metric | SMT Proofs | Our Reasoning | p-value | Cohen's d |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Clarity | 2.1 / 5 | 4.3 / 5 | p < 0.001 | 2.87 |
| Completeness | 3.8 / 5 | 4.5 / 5 | p < 0.01 | 0.94 |
| Trustworthiness | 4.7 / 5 | 4.2 / 5 | p = 0.08 | -0.51 |
| Usefulness | 2.3 / 5 | 4.6 / 5 | p < 0.001 | 3.12 |

**Statistical Power**: Post-hoc power analysis (α = 0.0125, n = 30, effect size d = 2.87) yields power > 0.99 for Clarity and Usefulness comparisons, indicating high statistical power.

### D.9 Qualitative Feedback Themes

**Positive Themes for Our Approach** (frequency):
1. Natural language clarity (28/30 participants)
2. Actionable insights for debugging (26/30)
3. Step-by-step reasoning transparency (25/30)
4. Domain-appropriate terminology (23/30)
5. Counterfactuals helpful for understanding (21/30)

**Negative Themes for SMT Proofs** (frequency):
1. Constraint IDs meaningless without context (29/30)
2. Requires expert knowledge to interpret (27/30)
3. No actionable remediation (25/30)
4. Formal notation off-putting (22/30)

**Mixed Feedback**:
- Some technical participants (4/10 software engineers) appreciated SMT's formal rigor but still preferred our explanations for practical use
- Domain experts universally preferred our approach (10/10)

### D.10 Limitations and Future Directions

**Study Limitations**:
1. **Sample Size**: 30 participants is modest; larger study would increase statistical power
2. **Problem Selection**: 12 problems per participant may not cover full complexity spectrum
3. **Domain Balance**: Medical diagnosis overrepresented for physician participants
4. **Ecological Validity**: Lab setting may not reflect real-world usage patterns

**Future Evaluation Directions**:
1. Longitudinal study tracking explanation utility over time
2. Task-based evaluation (e.g., debugging efficiency with each explanation type)
3. Eye-tracking to understand attention patterns
4. Cross-cultural study examining explanation preferences across cultures
