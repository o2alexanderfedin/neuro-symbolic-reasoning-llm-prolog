## 1. EXPLAINABLE AI (XAI) - FOUNDATIONAL WORK

### LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

**Citation:**
Ribeiro, M. T., Singh, S., & Guestrin, C. (2016). "Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier. *Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining*, 1135-1144.

**DOI:** 10.1145/2939672.2939778
**arXiv:** 1602.04938
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938

**Key Concepts:**
- Model-agnostic post-hoc explanations
- Local linear approximations of black-box models
- Interpretable representation of features
- Trust and transparency in ML predictions

**How Our Approach Differs:**
LIME provides post-hoc explanations by approximating complex models locally with interpretable ones. Our logic-based approach offers **intrinsic explanations** where the reasoning process itself is transparent and directly inspectable, eliminating the need for separate explanation models that may not be faithful to the original.

### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

**Citation:**
Lundberg, S. M., & Lee, S.-I. (2017). A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions. *Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)*, 4765-4774.

**DOI:** 10.5555/3295222.3295230
**arXiv:** 1705.07874
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874

**Key Concepts:**
- Unified framework for feature attribution
- Game-theoretic foundation (Shapley values)
- Consistent and locally accurate attributions
- Model-agnostic explanation method

**How Our Approach Differs:**
SHAP uses Shapley values from cooperative game theory to attribute predictions to features post-hoc. While mathematically principled, these are still explanations of opaque models. Our logic programming approach provides **inherent interpretability** where every inference step follows explicit logical rules that can be traced and understood without additional attribution methods.

Resolution forms the computational basis of logic programming. The resolution proof tree provides a natural explanation structure - each inference step is explicit and traceable, supporting our thesis of intrinsic explainability.

---

### Semantics of Prolog (Van Emden & Kowalski, 1976)

**Citation:**
Van Emden, M. H., & Kowalski, R. A. (1976). The Semantics of Predicate Logic as a Programming Language. *Journal of the ACM*, 23(4), 733-742.

**DOI:** 10.1145/321978.321991

**Key Concepts:**
- Declarative semantics of logic programs
- Minimal Herbrand model
- Fixpoint semantics
- Operational vs. declarative semantics

**Relevance to Our Work:**
This foundational paper established that logic programs have both declarative (what) and procedural (how) interpretations. This duality supports explainability - we can explain both what a program computes (declarative) and how it computes it (procedural).

---

### Procedural Interpretation of Logic

**Citation:**
Kowalski, R. A. (1974). Predicate Logic as a Programming Language. *Proceedings of IFIP Congress*, 569-574.

**Key Concepts:**

## 10. GRADIENT-BASED EXPLANATIONS

### Saliency Maps

**Citation:**
Simonyan, K., Vedaldi, A., & Zisserman, A. (2014). Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps. *Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) Workshop*.

**How Our Approach Differs:**
Saliency maps show which pixels most affect a prediction through gradients, but don't explain the decision logic. Our logic-based approach provides rule-based reasoning that explains why certain features lead to specific conclusions, not just which features are important.

---

### Grad-CAM

**arXiv:** 1711.00399
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00399

**Key Concepts:**

- GDPR compliance and right to explanation
- Model-agnostic approach

**How Our Approach Differs:**
Counterfactual explanations answer "what if" questions by finding minimal changes to inputs that alter predictions. While useful, they only show alternative scenarios, not the underlying decision logic. Our logic-based approach provides both: the explicit rules that led to a decision AND the ability to reason counterfactually about alternative scenarios through logical inference.

- Non-linear feature transformations
- Shape functions for individual features
- Balance between flexibility and interpretability

**Relevance to Our Work:**
GAMs demonstrate that interpretable models can achieve strong performance by design. Similarly, our logic-based approach provides interpretability through its fundamental structure (explicit rules and logical inference), not as an afterthought.

## 16. CONCLUSION AND RESEARCH POSITIONING

### Our Contribution to the Field

Our work on logic-based reasoning systems contributes to the growing body of evidence that **interpretable-by-design** systems should be preferred over **black-box-with-post-hoc-explanations** approaches, especially in domains requiring:

1. **High-Stakes Decisions**: Healthcare, legal, financial domains where decisions must be justified
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, AI Act, and other regulations requiring explainability
3. **Safety-Critical Systems**: Where understanding failure modes is essential
4. **Scientific Discovery**: Where understanding the reasoning process is as important as the result
5. **Knowledge Engineering**: Where domain expertise must be explicitly represented

### Key References Supporting Intrinsic Interpretability

- **Springer (2025)**: Contrasts inherent interpretability with post-hoc explainability
- **Molnar (2022)**: Taxonomizes interpretability, distinguishing intrinsic from post-hoc
- **Gelfond & Lifschitz (1988, 1991)**: Provides formal foundations for declarative, interpretable logic
- **Kowalski (1979)**: Establishes the Logic + Control paradigm enabling multiple explanation levels

### Limitations Acknowledged

While our logic-based approach provides superior intrinsic explainability, we acknowledge:

1. **Learning Challenge**: Logic programs are harder to learn from data than neural networks (though ILP addresses this)
2. **Scalability**: Logical reasoning may face computational challenges at very large scales (addressed by modern ASP/CLP solvers)
3. **Perception Tasks**: Certain low-level perception tasks (image recognition, speech) are naturally suited to neural approaches
4. **Fuzzy Domains**: Some domains have inherent uncertainty that crisp logic may not capture well (though probabilistic extensions exist)

### Future Directions

Integration of our logic-based approach with:
- Neural-symbolic systems for perception + reasoning pipelines
- Probabilistic logic programming for uncertainty handling
- ILP for automatic rule learning from data
- Modern SAT/ASP solving techniques for scalability
- Interactive explanation interfaces for end-users
