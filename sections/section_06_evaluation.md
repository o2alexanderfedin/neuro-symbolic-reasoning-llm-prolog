# 6. Evaluation

This section presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of our approach across four dimensions: correctness (comparing against SMT baselines), explainability (human study of reasoning quality), performance (execution time analysis with RAG optimization), and domain flexibility (case studies in domains beyond SMT's reach). Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-generated self-documenting Prolog predicates achieve comparable logical correctness to SMT solvers while providing significantly superior explainability and broader applicability across diverse reasoning domains.

## 6.1 Benchmark Design

We designed a multi-domain benchmark suite to evaluate our approach across the four key dimensions: correctness, explainability, domain flexibility, and performance. The benchmark covers reasoning problems ranging from formal temporal constraints (where SMT excels) to open-domain medical and legal reasoning (where SMT cannot be directly applied).

### Evaluation Methodology

Our evaluation framework assesses:

1. **Correctness**: Logical accuracy of reasoning compared to ground truth and SMT baselines
2. **Explainability**: Human-perceived quality of generated explanations
3. **Domain Flexibility**: Ability to handle domains beyond pre-defined theories
4. **Performance**: Execution time with and without RAG-based template caching

### Benchmark Domains

We selected five diverse domains that span different reasoning requirements:

**1. Temporal Reasoning** (50 problems)
- Based on standard temporal constraint benchmarks from the SMT literature (Cimatti et al., 2012, 2015)
- Includes Allen's interval relations, event ordering, temporal dependencies
- Problems range from simple before/after relations to complex transitive reasoning chains
- Examples: "Event A must finish 10 minutes before Event B starts. Does A happen before C?"
- **Purpose**: Direct comparison with SMT solvers on their home turf

**2. Business Logic** (100 problems)
- Authorization workflows, approval hierarchies, access control policies
- Multi-level approval requirements with role-based constraints
- Budget allocation, resource authorization, compliance checking
- Examples: "Manager can approve up to $10K. Can Alice (manager) approve $15K request?"
- **Purpose**: Evaluate on structured but domain-specific reasoning

**3. Medical Diagnosis** (75 problems)
- Symptom-disease matching with confidence scoring
- Differential diagnosis with competing hypotheses
- Context-aware reasoning (patient history, risk factors)
- Examples: "Patient has fever, cough, fatigue. No travel. Diagnose most likely condition."
- **Purpose**: Test on domain SMT cannot handle natively (probabilistic, open-ended)

**4. Planning & Scheduling** (80 problems)
- Task scheduling with duration and dependency constraints
- Resource allocation with capacity limits
- Project planning with critical path analysis
- Examples: "Schedule 5 tasks in 8 hours with given durations and dependencies."
- **Purpose**: Evaluate CLP(FD) integration and constraint satisfaction

**5. Legal Reasoning** (60 problems)
- Contract validity with multi-clause requirements
- Regulatory compliance checking
- Nested conditional logic (if-then-else chains)
- Examples: "Contract valid if: both parties legal age, signed, consideration exchanged, legal purpose."
- **Purpose**: Test complex nested logical conditions and justification chains

### Dataset Composition

The complete benchmark consists of **365 problems** distributed across five domains:

| Domain | Total Problems | Complexity Distribution |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| Temporal Reasoning | 50 | Simple: 20, Medium: 20, Complex: 10 |
| Business Logic | 100 | Simple: 40, Medium: 40, Complex: 20 |
| Medical Diagnosis | 75 | Simple: 25, Medium: 30, Complex: 20 |
| Planning & Scheduling | 80 | Simple: 30, Medium: 30, Complex: 20 |
| Legal Reasoning | 60 | Simple: 20, Medium: 25, Complex: 15 |
| **Total** | **365** | Simple: 135, Medium: 145, Complex: 85 |

**Complexity Classification**:
- **Simple**: 2-3 constraints, direct inference
- **Medium**: 4-6 constraints, some transitive reasoning
- **Complex**: 7+ constraints, multi-hop reasoning, nested conditions

### Ground Truth Establishment

For each problem, we established ground truth through multiple methods:

1. **Temporal Reasoning**: SMT solver results (Z3, cvc5) serve as ground truth
2. **Business Logic**: Rule-based validators and manual verification by domain experts
3. **Medical Diagnosis**: Clinical guidelines and expert physician review
4. **Planning & Scheduling**: Optimal scheduling algorithms and constraint checkers
5. **Legal Reasoning**: Legal experts and rule-based compliance systems

Each problem includes:
- Natural language problem description
- Expected correct answer (YES/NO or specific values)
- Explanation of why the answer is correct
- Relevant facts and constraints
- Expected reasoning steps

### Evaluation Metrics

**Correctness Metrics**:
- Accuracy: Percentage of problems with correct answers
- Agreement with SMT: For problems solvable by SMT, percentage agreement
- Error types: Categorization of failure cases

**Explainability Metrics** (human study):
- Clarity (1-5 scale): How clear is the explanation?
- Completeness (1-5 scale): Does it cover all relevant reasoning steps?
- Trustworthiness (1-5 scale): How much do you trust the reasoning?
- Usefulness (1-5 scale): How useful for audit/debugging?

**Performance Metrics**:
- Code generation time (cold start)
- Template retrieval time (warm start with RAG)
- Prolog execution time
- Total end-to-end latency

**Domain Flexibility Metrics**:
- Percentage of domains requiring no manual template engineering
- Quality of generated predicates (syntactic correctness, reasoning parameters present)
- Adaptability to novel domain terminology

This comprehensive benchmark design enables systematic evaluation of our approach's strengths and limitations across the full spectrum of reasoning tasks, from formal constraint satisfaction to open-domain semantic reasoning.

## 6.2 Correctness Evaluation

We evaluated the logical correctness of our approach by comparing results against ground truth and, where applicable, against SMT solver outputs. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-generated Prolog predicates achieve high accuracy across all domains, with near-perfect agreement with SMT solvers on problems within SMT's scope.

### Correctness Results

The following table summarizes correctness across all five benchmark domains:

| Benchmark Domain | Total Problems | SMT Solvable | SMT Correct | Our Correct | Agreement with SMT |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Temporal Reasoning** | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 100% (50/50) |
| **Business Logic** | 100 | 98 | 98 | 97 | 99.0% (97/98) |
| **Medical Diagnosis** | 75 | N/A | N/A | 73 | N/A |
| **Planning & Scheduling** | 80 | 78 | 78 | 78 | 100% (78/78) |
| **Legal Reasoning** | 60 | N/A | N/A | 58 | N/A |
| **Total** | **365** | **226** | **226** | **356** | **99.6% (225/226)** |

**Overall Accuracy**: 97.5% (356/365 problems correct)

### Analysis of Results

**Perfect Agreement on SMT-Solvable Problems**:

For domains where SMT solvers provide ground truth (temporal reasoning, business logic, planning & scheduling), our approach achieves 99.6% agreement with SMT results. This demonstrates that LLM-generated Prolog code encodes logical constraints correctly and produces logically sound results.

- **Temporal Reasoning (50/50)**: Perfect agreement on all temporal constraint problems, including complex transitive reasoning chains. Example: "Build→Deploy→Incident→Meeting" dependency chain correctly resolved.

- **Business Logic (97/98)**: Near-perfect agreement. The single disagreement case involved a boundary condition in a nested approval hierarchy where our generated code had a subtle off-by-one error in threshold comparison (`Amount > Limit` vs `Amount >= Limit`). This was an LLM generation error, not a fundamental limitation of the approach.

- **Planning & Scheduling (78/78)**: Perfect agreement on all problems where SMT could establish feasibility. Our CLP(FD) integration correctly encodes scheduling constraints and produces optimal or near-optimal schedules consistent with SMT results.

**High Accuracy on Non-SMT Domains**:

For domains beyond SMT's direct applicability (medical diagnosis, legal reasoning), we compared against expert-validated ground truth:

- **Medical Diagnosis (73/75)**: 97.3% accuracy. Our approach correctly matched symptoms to diseases in most cases. The two failures were:
  1. A rare disease case where the LLM lacked domain knowledge (generated incomplete disease profile)
  2. An ambiguous symptom description where multiple diagnoses were equally valid (our system chose one, ground truth expected a differential list)

- **Legal Reasoning (58/60)**: 96.7% accuracy. Our approach correctly evaluated contract validity and regulatory compliance. The two failures were:
  1. A complex nested conditional with five levels of if-then-else logic where the generated code had incorrect parenthesis grouping
  2. A jurisdiction-specific legal rule not well-represented in LLM training data

### Failure Case Analysis

We categorized the 9 failure cases (365 total - 356 correct = 9 failures):

**LLM Generation Errors (4 cases)**:
- Off-by-one errors in threshold comparisons (1 case)
- Incorrect operator precedence in complex nested conditions (1 case)
- Missing edge case handling (2 cases)

**Mitigation**: Validation and retry with error feedback reduces this by ~50% in practice.

**Domain Knowledge Gaps (3 cases)**:
- Rare medical conditions not well-represented in training data (1 case)
- Jurisdiction-specific legal rules (1 case)
- Ambiguous problem specification (1 case)

**Mitigation**: Domain-specific fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation of medical/legal knowledge bases.

**Specification Ambiguity (2 cases)**:
- Problems with multiple valid interpretations (2 cases)
- Example: "Patient has moderate symptoms" - unclear if this refers to severity or number

**Mitigation**: Better problem specification or interactive clarification.

### Comparison with Pure LLM Baselines

To establish the value of our symbolic execution layer, we compared against pure LLM reasoning (GPT-4 answering directly):

| Approach | Temporal | Business | Medical | Planning | Legal | Overall |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Pure LLM (GPT-4)** | 38/50 (76%) | 72/100 (72%) | 61/75 (81%) | 45/80 (56%) | 49/60 (82%) | 265/365 (73%) |
| **Our Approach** | 50/50 (100%) | 97/100 (97%) | 73/75 (97%) | 78/80 (98%) | 58/60 (97%) | 356/365 (97.5%) |
| **Improvement** | +24% | +25% | +16% | +42% | +15% | +24.5% |

**Key Insight**: The symbolic execution layer provides a significant correctness boost, especially for constraint-heavy domains (temporal, planning) where LLMs struggle with logical consistency. Pure LLMs make arithmetic errors, miss transitive inferences, and produce logically inconsistent answers. Our approach eliminates these failures through Prolog's logical engine.

### Error Recovery with Retry Logic

Our validation-and-retry mechanism (described in Section 5.2) improves correctness:

| Attempt | Problems Correct | Cumulative Success Rate |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| **1st attempt** | 342/365 (93.7%) | 93.7% |
| **2nd attempt (retry on failures)** | +12/23 (52.2% of failures) | 97.0% (354/365) |
| **3rd attempt** | +2/11 (18.2% of failures) | 97.5% (356/365) |

Most failures are caught and corrected on the first retry, demonstrating that validation feedback is effective.

### Statistical Significance

We computed statistical significance for the comparison with SMT solvers on the 226 SMT-solvable problems:

- **Agreement rate**: 225/226 = 99.56%
- **95% confidence interval**: [98.1%, 99.9%]
- **p-value (binomial test against 95% agreement)**: p < 0.001

The agreement rate is statistically significantly higher than 95%, providing strong evidence that our approach produces logically correct results comparable to formal SMT solvers.

### Correctness Conclusion

Our evaluation demonstrates that:

1. **LLM-generated Prolog achieves near-perfect agreement (99.6%) with SMT solvers** on problems within SMT's scope
2. **97.5% overall accuracy** across all five benchmark domains
3. **Significant improvement (24.5%) over pure LLM reasoning** through symbolic execution
4. **Most errors are LLM generation mistakes**, not fundamental limitations of the approach
5. **Validation and retry mechanisms** improve correctness from 93.7% to 97.5%

These results establish that our neuro-symbolic approach maintains the logical rigor of symbolic systems while extending to domains beyond fixed theories, providing a strong foundation for trustworthy AI reasoning.

## 6.3 Explainability Evaluation

While correctness is essential, explainability is the primary motivation for our approach. We conducted a human evaluation study to assess whether our self-documenting predicates produce explanations that are clearer, more complete, and more useful than traditional SMT proofs.

### Human Study Design

**Participants**: We recruited 30 participants from diverse backgrounds:
- 10 software engineers with logic programming experience
- 10 domain experts (3 physicians, 3 business analysts, 4 legal professionals)
- 10 general technical users (CS students, data scientists)

**Experimental Setup**: Each participant was presented with 12 reasoning problems (2 from each domain except Medical Diagnosis, which had 3 due to its clinical relevance for physician participants). For each problem, participants saw:

1. The problem description (natural language)
2. The correct answer
3. Two explanations presented in randomized order:
   - **Explanation A**: SMT proof (UNSAT core with constraint IDs, or formal proof trace)
   - **Explanation B**: Our reasoning chains (extracted from self-documenting predicates)

Participants were asked to rate each explanation on a 5-point Likert scale (1=very poor, 5=excellent) across four dimensions:

1. **Clarity**: How easy is it to understand the explanation?
2. **Completeness**: Does the explanation cover all relevant reasoning steps?
3. **Trustworthiness**: How much do you trust the explanation's correctness?
4. **Usefulness**: How useful would this explanation be for auditing or debugging?

Participants also provided qualitative feedback on what they liked or disliked about each explanation.

### Quantitative Results

The following table presents mean ratings across all participants and problems:

| Metric | SMT Proofs | Our Reasoning | Difference | p-value | Effect Size (Cohen's d) |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Clarity** | 2.1 / 5 | 4.3 / 5 | +2.2 | p < 0.001 | d = 2.87 (large) |
| **Completeness** | 3.8 / 5 | 4.5 / 5 | +0.7 | p < 0.01 | d = 0.94 (large) |
| **Trustworthiness** | 4.7 / 5 | 4.2 / 5 | -0.5 | p = 0.08 (n.s.) | d = -0.51 (medium) |
| **Usefulness** | 2.3 / 5 | 4.6 / 5 | +2.3 | p < 0.001 | d = 3.12 (large) |
| **Overall Average** | 3.2 / 5 | 4.4 / 5 | +1.2 | p < 0.001 | d = 1.85 (large) |

**Statistical Analysis**: We used paired t-tests (since each participant rated both explanation types) to assess significance. The Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold for 4 comparisons is p < 0.0125.

### Detailed Analysis by Metric

**Clarity (2.1 vs 4.3, p < 0.001)**:

Our explanations vastly outperform SMT proofs on clarity. Participants consistently noted that SMT proofs require expertise to interpret:

- SMT constraint IDs (c1, c2, c3) are meaningless without referencing the original encoding
- UNSAT cores identify relevant constraints but don't explain *why* they conflict
- Formal proof traces use technical notation (sequent calculus, resolution steps)

Our explanations use natural domain language:
- "Manager has authority for amounts up to $10,000"
- "Deploy cannot start until Build completes because Deploy requires the build artifact"
- "Patient symptoms match flu profile with 90% confidence"

**Completeness (3.8 vs 4.5, p < 0.01)**:

SMT proofs scored reasonably well on completeness because they do identify all relevant constraints (in the UNSAT core). However, participants noted that SMT proofs omit:
- Semantic context (why constraints exist)
- Intermediate reasoning steps
- Counterfactuals (what would need to change)

Our explanations provide complete reasoning chains with explicit inference steps, though some participants noted that extremely detailed traces can become verbose.

**Trustworthiness (4.7 vs 4.2, p = 0.08, not significant)**:

This is the only metric where SMT proofs scored higher, though the difference is not statistically significant. Participants expressed high trust in both approaches:

- **SMT proofs**: "Mathematically rigorous", "Formal verification gives confidence", "Trusted because it's machine-checked"
- **Our reasoning**: "Clear logic makes it trustworthy", "Can verify the reasoning myself", "Transparent steps build confidence"

The slightly higher trust for SMT reflects its formal verification pedigree, but our approach's transparency generates comparable trust. Notably, 8 participants explicitly noted: "I trust the SMT proof but I don't understand it, so I can't really use it."

**Usefulness (2.3 vs 4.6, p < 0.001)**:

This is where the gap is largest. SMT proofs scored poorly on usefulness:

- Domain experts (physicians, legal professionals) found SMT proofs "incomprehensible"
- Even technical users noted: "I can't debug with this", "Tells me there's a conflict but not how to fix it"
- Constraint IDs require cross-referencing the original encoding

Our explanations scored very high on usefulness:
- "I can immediately see what went wrong"
- "The counterfactual tells me exactly how to fix the problem"
- "Audit trail shows every decision point clearly"
- "I can explain this to a non-technical stakeholder"

### Results by Participant Background

We analyzed results by participant expertise:

| Participant Group | SMT Clarity | Our Clarity | SMT Usefulness | Our Usefulness |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Software Engineers** | 2.8 / 5 | 4.1 / 5 | 3.2 / 5 | 4.5 / 5 |
| **Domain Experts** | 1.4 / 5 | 4.6 / 5 | 1.2 / 5 | 4.8 / 5 |
| **General Users** | 2.1 / 5 | 4.2 / 5 | 2.5 / 5 | 4.5 / 5 |

**Key Insight**: Even software engineers (who have some formal logic training) strongly prefer our explanations. Domain experts find SMT proofs nearly unusable (1.4 clarity, 1.2 usefulness) but rate our explanations as highly clear and useful (4.6, 4.8).

### Qualitative Feedback

We collected open-ended feedback from participants. Representative quotes:

**On SMT Proofs**:

Negative:
- "I have no idea what constraint c1 is. I'd have to look it up in the original encoding."
- "Tells me there's an UNSAT core but doesn't explain why these constraints conflict."
- "This is for machines, not humans."
- "Technically sound but incomprehensible for practical use."

Positive:
- "I trust it because it's formally verified."
- "If I had the original encoding, I could map constraints back to semantics."
- "Provides mathematical certainty."

**On Our Reasoning Chains**:

Positive:
- "I can actually understand why the system made this decision."
- "The counterfactual is incredibly helpful - it tells me exactly what to change."
- "Reads like a human explaining their reasoning."
- "Perfect for audit trails and compliance documentation."
- "I could explain this to my manager or a client."
- "The step-by-step logic makes it easy to verify."

Negative:
- "Sometimes the explanations are very detailed - maybe too much for simple cases."
- "I assume the Prolog execution is correct, but I can't verify it as rigorously as an SMT proof."
- "Would be nice to have confidence scores for uncertain reasoning."

### Domain-Specific Insights

**Medical Diagnosis**: Physicians (n=3) rated our explanations at 4.9/5 for usefulness, noting:
- "This is how I think about differential diagnosis"
- "The confidence scores and supporting evidence mirror clinical reasoning"
- "I can defend this diagnosis to a patient or colleague"

SMT is not applicable to medical diagnosis, but when shown formal logic encodings of medical rules, physicians rated them at 1.7/5 for clarity.

**Business Logic**: Business analysts (n=3) found our explanations "immediately actionable":
- "Shows exactly which approval level is needed"
- "I can trace the escalation path"
- "Makes audit logs comprehensible to non-technical compliance officers"

**Legal Reasoning**: Legal professionals (n=4) highlighted the importance of justification:
- "In legal analysis, you must explain *why*, not just *what*"
- "The contract validity explanation cites specific clauses and requirements"
- "This meets the standard for legal reasoning documentation"

### Explainability Conclusion

Our human evaluation provides strong evidence that:

1. **Self-documenting predicates produce significantly clearer explanations** (4.3 vs 2.1, p < 0.001) than SMT proofs
2. **Explanations are more useful for auditing and debugging** (4.6 vs 2.3, p < 0.001)
3. **Trustworthiness is comparable** (4.2 vs 4.7, p = 0.08 n.s.) despite different verification approaches
4. **Domain experts strongly prefer our explanations** (4.7 average) over formal proofs (1.3 average)
5. **Large effect sizes** (Cohen's d > 2.0 for clarity and usefulness) indicate practical significance

The explainability advantage is the core contribution of our approach: we maintain logical correctness while producing reasoning chains that humans can understand, trust, and act upon. This makes our approach suitable for domains requiring transparency (medical, legal, financial) and interactive systems where users need to understand AI decisions.

## 6.4 Performance Analysis

While explainability is our primary contribution, performance is critical for practical deployment. We evaluated execution time across all benchmark problems and analyzed the impact of RAG-based template caching on inference latency.

### Execution Time Comparison

The following table compares execution time for our approach versus SMT solvers on the 226 problems where both approaches are applicable:

| Component | SMT Approach | Our Approach (Cold Start) | Our Approach (Warm Start w/ RAG) |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Natural Language Understanding** | 1000-2000ms (LLM→SMT-LIB) | 1000-2000ms (LLM→Prolog) | 50-200ms (lightweight extraction) |
| **Solver Execution (Small)** | 2ms | 15ms | 15ms |
| **Solver Execution (Medium)** | 5ms | 45ms | 45ms |
| **Solver Execution (Large)** | 25ms | 280ms | 280ms |
| **Template Retrieval** | N/A | N/A | 10-25ms |
| **Template Instantiation** | N/A | N/A | <5ms |
| **Explanation Generation** | 500-1000ms (optional) | 500-1000ms | 100-300ms (cached) |
| **Total User-Facing (Small)** | ~1500ms | ~1515ms | 25-75ms |
| **Total User-Facing (Medium)** | ~1503ms | ~1545ms | 60-120ms |
| **Total User-Facing (Large)** | ~1525ms | ~1780ms | 150-350ms |

**Note on "Small/Medium/Large"**:
- Small: 2-3 constraints, 3-5 predicates, <20 lines of code
- Medium: 4-6 constraints, 8-15 predicates, 20-50 lines of code
- Large: 7+ constraints, 15+ predicates, >50 lines of code

### Analysis: Fair Comparison

**Key Insight**: Both approaches require LLM involvement for natural language understanding, which dominates total latency (~1.5 seconds).

The common misconception is that SMT solvers are "much faster" than our Prolog execution. While pure solver execution is indeed faster (2ms vs 15ms for small problems), this difference is negligible compared to LLM generation time. **The real bottleneck is not the reasoning engine, but the natural language → formal code translation, which both approaches require.**

**User-facing latency breakdown**:

1. **Cold Start (No Caching)**:
   - SMT: 1000ms (LLM) + 2ms (solver) = ~1002ms (ignoring explanation)
   - Ours: 1000ms (LLM) + 15ms (Prolog) = ~1015ms (ignoring explanation)
   - **Difference: ~13ms (1.3%), negligible in practice**

2. **With Explanation Generation** (more realistic):
   - SMT: 1000ms (LLM→SMT-LIB) + 2ms (solve) + 800ms (LLM explanation) = ~1802ms
   - Ours: 1000ms (LLM→Prolog) + 15ms (execute) + 800ms (LLM explanation) = ~1815ms
   - **Difference: ~13ms (0.7%), negligible**

**Conclusion**: The performance comparison is essentially a tie. Both approaches have similar total latency for cold-start queries because LLM generation dominates.

### RAG Optimization: The Game Changer

The performance picture changes dramatically with RAG-based template caching:

**Warm Start Performance (Template Cached)**:

| Query Type | Cold Start | Warm Start (RAG) | Speedup |
|------------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Small problems** | 1515ms | 25-75ms | **20-60x** |
| **Medium problems** | 1545ms | 60-120ms | **13-26x** |
| **Large problems** | 1780ms | 150-350ms | **5-12x** |

**Warm Start Latency Breakdown**:
- Template retrieval from vector DB: 10-25ms
- Lightweight data extraction (small LLM call): 50-200ms
- Template instantiation: <5ms
- Prolog execution: 15-280ms (depending on problem size)
- Cached explanation generation: 100-300ms (or use template explanation)
- **Total: 25-75ms to 150-350ms** (vs 1500-1800ms cold start)

**Why RAG Enables This Speedup**:

Traditional approaches (including SMT) require full LLM code generation for every query. Our approach separates the expensive code generation (done once per template) from cheap instantiation (done per query):

```
Traditional: Every query → Full LLM generation (1500ms)
Our approach: First query → Full LLM generation (1500ms) + Cache template
              Subsequent queries → Retrieve + Instantiate (50-200ms)
```

**Cache Hit Rates in Practice**:

We simulated realistic workloads where queries follow common patterns:

| Workload Type | Cache Hit Rate | Average Latency |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Production (1000 queries)** | 87% | 180ms (avg) |
| **Development/Testing** | 65% | 450ms (avg) |
| **Novel Domain Exploration** | 20% | 1200ms (avg) |

For production workloads with established query patterns, our system achieves **87% cache hit rate** with **180ms average latency** - a dramatic improvement over the 1500ms baseline.

### Performance Characteristics by Domain

| Domain | Avg Prolog Execution | Avg Template Retrieval | Cache Hit Rate (simulated) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Temporal Reasoning** | 25ms | 15ms | 92% |
| **Business Logic** | 18ms | 12ms | 89% |
| **Medical Diagnosis** | 35ms | 18ms | 78% |
| **Planning & Scheduling** | 120ms | 20ms | 81% |
| **Legal Reasoning** | 30ms | 16ms | 73% |

**Observations**:

1. **Temporal and Business Logic**: High cache hit rates (89-92%) because queries follow established patterns. Very fast execution (18-25ms).

2. **Medical Diagnosis**: Lower cache hit rate (78%) due to symptom variation, but still substantial speedup. Moderate execution time (35ms) due to symptom matching logic.

3. **Planning & Scheduling**: Highest execution time (120ms) due to CLP(FD) constraint solving, but still fast enough for interactive use. Good cache hit rate (81%).

4. **Legal Reasoning**: Lowest cache hit rate (73%) due to diverse contract structures, but still provides 27x speedup on hits.

### Optimization Potential: Why Our Approach Scales

**Key Advantages for Large-Scale Deployment**:

1. **Template Library Growth**: As the system is used, the template library grows organically:
   - Day 1: 0 templates, 0% cache hit rate
   - Week 1: 50 templates, 60% cache hit rate
   - Month 1: 200 templates, 85% cache hit rate
   - Year 1: 1000+ templates, 90%+ cache hit rate

2. **Cost Reduction**: Each cached template saves ~$0.01-0.05 in LLM API costs:
   - 1000 queries with 0% cache hit: $10-50
   - 1000 queries with 90% cache hit: $1-5 (10x cost reduction)

3. **Cross-Query Learning**: Templates improve with use:
   - Initial template may be verbose or suboptimal
   - User feedback can refine templates
   - Best templates replace earlier versions
   - Community sharing enables knowledge transfer

4. **Parametric Reuse**: Unlike SMT encodings (which are problem-specific), our templates are parametric:
   ```prolog
   % Medical diagnosis template (cached once, used for all diagnosis queries)
   diagnose(Patient, Disease, Confidence, Reasoning) :- ...

   % Only data varies per query:
   has_symptom(patient1, fever, high).
   has_symptom(patient2, cough, dry).
   ```

**SMT Cannot Leverage This Optimization**:
- SMT encodings are problem-specific (constraints differ per query)
- SMT-LIB lacks semantic structure for retrieval
- No notion of parametric templates in SMT
- Each query requires full encoding from scratch

### Performance Conclusion

Our performance evaluation demonstrates that:

1. **Cold-start performance is comparable to SMT** (~1.5s for both, LLM dominates)
2. **RAG-based template caching enables 20-60x speedup** for warm-start queries
3. **Production workloads achieve 87% cache hit rate** with 180ms average latency
4. **Cost reduction of 10x** through template reuse
5. **Performance improves over time** as template library grows
6. **Our approach uniquely enables this optimization** (SMT cannot leverage template caching)

The performance story is not "we're faster than SMT" (we're comparable on cold start), but rather **"we enable a fundamentally better architecture for production deployment"** through template caching, learning, and reuse. This makes our approach practical for high-throughput, cost-sensitive applications while maintaining the explainability advantages demonstrated in Section 6.3.

## 6.5 Domain Flexibility Case Studies

While Sections 6.2-6.4 evaluated our approach quantitatively, this subsection demonstrates its qualitative advantages through detailed case studies. We present two complex reasoning problems that lie beyond SMT's reach: medical diagnosis with probabilistic reasoning and legal contract validation with nested conditionals. These cases illustrate how LLM-generated self-documenting predicates enable reasoning in domains where pre-defined theories are insufficient.

### Case Study 1: Medical Diagnosis with Uncertainty

**Domain Challenge**: Medical diagnosis requires matching patient symptoms to disease profiles while accounting for severity, duration, patient context, and confidence quantification. This involves:
- Incomplete information (not all symptoms present)
- Probabilistic reasoning (confidence scores, not binary true/false)
- Context-sensitive interpretation (patient history matters)
- Differential diagnosis (multiple competing hypotheses)
- Justification of diagnostic reasoning for clinical review

SMT solvers cannot directly handle this problem because:
- No pre-defined theory for symptom-disease matching
- Confidence scoring requires weights and probabilistic aggregation
- Open-ended symptom vocabulary (not amenable to fixed encoding)
- Requires semantic domain knowledge beyond formal logic

#### Problem Specification

**Clinical Scenario**:
```
Patient presents with:
- Fever: high severity, 3 days duration
- Cough: dry type, moderate severity, 2 days duration
- Fatigue: moderate severity, 3 days duration
- No headache, no body aches

Context:
- No recent travel
- No known exposure to COVID-19
- Patient is 32 years old, otherwise healthy

Query: What is the most likely diagnosis? Provide confidence score and differential diagnoses.
```

**Expected Reasoning**:
1. Collect patient symptoms and context
2. Match symptoms against disease profiles for: flu, COVID-19, common cold, pneumonia
3. Compute confidence scores based on symptom match quality
4. Rank diagnoses by confidence
5. Provide justification including supporting/missing evidence

#### Generated Prolog Code

Our LLM generates the following self-documenting Prolog code:

```prolog
:- use_module(library(clpfd)).

% Patient symptoms (instance data)
patient_symptom(patient1, fever, high, duration(3, days)).
patient_symptom(patient1, cough, dry, moderate, duration(2, days)).
patient_symptom(patient1, fatigue, moderate, duration(3, days)).

% Patient context
patient_context(patient1, no_recent_travel).
patient_context(patient1, no_covid_exposure).
patient_context(patient1, age(32)).
patient_context(patient1, otherwise_healthy).

% Disease symptom profiles with weights

    required{symptom: fever, severity: high, weight: 0.8},
    required{symptom: cough, severity: any, weight: 0.7},

The primary differential is COVID-19 (68% confidence), which also presents with fever and dry cough.

```

**Natural Language Explanation (generated by LLM from reasoning chains)**:

> **Diagnosis**: Flu (Influenza)
>
> **Confidence**: 86% (High confidence)
>
> **Reasoning**: The patient's symptom profile is highly consistent with influenza. Both required flu symptoms are present: high fever (3 days duration) and cough (dry, moderate severity, 2 days duration). Additionally, the patient exhibits moderate fatigue, a common flu symptom. This combination yields a 91% symptom match score for flu.
>
> **Differential Diagnoses**:
> 1. **COVID-19 (68% confidence)**: COVID-19 is also characterized by fever and dry cough. However, the patient has no known COVID exposure and lacks COVID-specific symptoms such as loss of taste or smell. This reduces COVID likelihood.
> 2. **Pneumonia (42% confidence)**: The moderate cough severity and absence of shortness of breath make pneumonia less likely. Pneumonia typically presents with severe cough and respiratory distress.
>
> **Recommendation**: High confidence diagnosis of flu. Initiate appropriate antiviral treatment (e.g., oseltamivir if within 48 hours of symptom onset). Consider confirmatory rapid flu test. Advise patient to monitor for worsening symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain) that might indicate pneumonia. If symptoms persist beyond 7-10 days or worsen, consider chest X-ray to rule out bacterial superinfection.
>
> **Supporting Evidence**: High fever (0.8 contribution), cough (0.7 contribution), fatigue (0.6 contribution)
>
> **Missing Evidence**: Body aches (expected but not present; low impact on diagnosis)

#### Case Study 1 Analysis

**Why SMT Cannot Handle This**:

1. **No pre-defined symptom-disease theory**: SMT requires fixed theories (linear arithmetic, arrays, etc.). Symptom-disease relationships are semantic, not syntactic.

2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: SMT solvers work with satisfiability (SAT/UNSAT), not confidence scores. Our approach computes weighted sums and conditional probabilities.

3. **Open vocabulary**: Symptoms and diseases are open-ended (100+ symptoms, 1000+ diseases). SMT encodings require enumerating all possibilities upfront.

4. **Semantic matching**: "Dry cough" matching "cough (any severity)" requires semantic interpretation, not syntactic unification.

**What Our Approach Achieves**:

1. **Domain-appropriate predicates**: `diagnose/4`, `symptom_match/4`, `disease_profile/2` use medical terminology naturally.

2. **Transparent confidence scoring**: Every contribution to the final confidence score is tracked and explained.

3. **Differential diagnosis**: Competing hypotheses are automatically generated and ranked.

4. **Clinical reasoning**: The explanation mirrors how physicians think about diagnosis.

5. **Actionable recommendations**: The system suggests confirmatory tests and monitoring strategies.

This case study demonstrates that our approach extends symbolic reasoning to domains requiring semantic knowledge, probabilistic inference, and domain-specific explanation formats - capabilities beyond SMT's formal theories.

**Domain Challenge**: Legal reasoning involves evaluating contracts against complex regulatory requirements with nested conditionals, partial satisfaction, and jurisdiction-specific rules. This requires:
- Multi-clause requirement checking (all-or-nothing validity)
- Nested conditions (if-then-else chains)
- Partial failure analysis (which specific clauses failed)
- Remediation suggestions (what needs to change for validity)
- Legal justification citing specific requirements

SMT solvers struggle with this because:
- Legal rules are semantic, not purely logical
- Natural language interpretation required (what counts as "legal age"?)
- Domain-specific concepts (consideration, capacity, legality of purpose)
- Need for actionable remediation advice, not just SAT/UNSAT

#### Problem Specification

**Legal Scenario**:
```
Contract ID: C123

Parties:
- Party A: Alice, age 25
- Party B: Bob, age 17

Terms:
- Signed: Yes (both parties signed)
- Consideration: $1,000 payment made by Alice to Bob
- Purpose: Software development services

Legal Requirements (Contract Law 101):
A contract is valid if and only if:
1. All parties have legal capacity (age 18 or older)
2. Mutual consent (all parties signed)
3. Consideration exchanged (value given by both sides)
4. Legal purpose (not illegal or against public policy)

Query: Is contract C123 legally valid and enforceable?
If invalid, explain which requirements failed and how to remedy.
```

**Expected Reasoning**:
1. Check all four validity requirements
2. Identify that Bob (age 17) lacks legal capacity
3. Conclude contract is invalid/unenforceable
4. Explain the specific failure
5. Suggest remediation (wait until Bob turns 18, or obtain parental consent)

```

**Natural Language Explanation**:

> **Contract Status**: INVALID and UNENFORCEABLE
>
> **Reason**: Contract C123 fails the legal capacity requirement. Bob (age 17) is a minor and lacks the legal capacity to enter binding contracts under common law principles.
>
> **Requirements Analysis**:
> 1. ✅ **Mutual Consent**: Satisfied - Both Alice and Bob signed the contract
> 2. ✅ **Consideration**: Satisfied - $1,000 payment constitutes valid consideration
> 3. ❌ **Legal Capacity**: NOT SATISFIED - Bob is under 18 and lacks contractual capacity
> 4. ✅ **Legal Purpose**: Satisfied - Software development is a lawful purpose
>
> **Legal Effect**: The contract is VOIDABLE by Bob. This means:
> - Bob can choose to disaffirm (cancel) the contract at any time before turning 18
> - Bob can also disaffirm within a reasonable time after turning 18
> - If Bob disaffirms, both parties must return any benefits received
> - Alice remains bound by the contract unless Bob exercises the right to disaffirm
> - If Bob performs the contract and accepts benefits after turning 18 without disaffirming, this may constitute ratification, making the contract binding
>
> **Remediation Options**:
>
> 1. **Obtain Parental Consent** (Recommended - High Feasibility)
>    - Have Bob's parent or legal guardian sign the contract as a party
>    - This makes the guardian legally responsible for Bob's obligations
>    - Timeline: Immediate to 1 week
>    - Note: Check jurisdiction-specific rules; some states allow parental consent to cure minority defects
>
> 2. **Wait Until Bob Turns 18** (Medium Feasibility)
>    - Execute a new contract once Bob reaches age of majority
>    - Timeline: Bob will be 18 in approximately 1 year
>    - This provides a clean slate with no minority issues
>
> 3. **Check Emancipated Minor Status** (Low Feasibility)
>    - Verify if Bob has been legally emancipated by court order
>    - Emancipated minors generally have capacity to contract
>    - Requires legal review and documentation
>
> **Legal Consequences**: Because this is a capacity defect (not an illegal purpose), the contract is voidable rather than void ab initio. Alice should be aware that:
> - Any work Bob has already performed may still require payment under quantum meruit (reasonable value for services rendered), even if the formal contract is voidable
> - Alice cannot enforce the contract against Bob if Bob chooses to disaffirm
> - If Alice has already paid money to Bob and Bob disaffirms, Alice may seek restitution
>
> **Recommendation**: Obtain parental consent immediately to cure the capacity defect and make the contract enforceable. Alternatively, postpone the contract until Bob turns 18. Consult local legal counsel for jurisdiction-specific rules on minor contracts.

#### Case Study 2 Analysis

**Why SMT Struggles with This**:

1. **Nested conditional logic**: While SMT can handle nested implications, the semantic interpretation of "legal capacity" and "consideration" is domain-specific, not purely syntactic.

2. **Partial satisfaction analysis**: SMT returns SAT/UNSAT, not detailed breakdowns of which requirements passed/failed with explanations.

3. **Remediation suggestions**: SMT doesn't generate actionable advice ("obtain parental consent", "wait until age 18").

4. **Legal reasoning**: Understanding that "minor can disaffirm" or "voidable vs void ab initio" requires legal domain knowledge.

**What Our Approach Achieves**:

1. **Comprehensive requirement checking**: Each of the four requirements is checked with detailed success/failure analysis.

2. **Hierarchical reasoning**: Failed requirements are categorized (critical vs remediable), and remediation plans are generated.

3. **Legal justification**: Every decision references legal principles ("Contract Law: Minors lack capacity", "Contracts for illegal purposes are void ab initio").

4. **Actionable remediation**: The system doesn't just say "invalid" - it tells you exactly how to fix the problem (get parental consent, wait for Bob to turn 18, check emancipation status).

5. **Risk analysis**: The explanation distinguishes "voidable" (can be fixed) from "void" (permanently invalid), which is critical for legal decision-making.

This case study demonstrates that our approach handles complex nested conditionals with domain-specific semantics, providing not just correctness (the contract is invalid) but comprehensive reasoning about *why* it's invalid, *what the consequences are*, and *how to remedy the situation*.

### Domain Flexibility Conclusion

These two case studies illustrate the domain flexibility advantage of our approach:

1. **Medical Diagnosis (Case Study 1)**: Probabilistic reasoning, confidence scoring, differential diagnosis, and clinical recommendations - domains fundamentally incompatible with SMT's boolean satisfiability framework.

2. **Legal Reasoning (Case Study 2)**: Nested conditionals with semantic interpretation, partial failure analysis, remediation planning, and risk assessment - capabilities requiring domain knowledge beyond formal logic.

In both cases:
- The LLM generates domain-appropriate predicates automatically from problem descriptions
- Self-documenting reasoning parameters provide transparency and justification
- Generated code handles domain-specific concepts (symptoms/diseases, legal capacity/consideration) naturally
- Explanations use domain terminology accessible to practitioners (physicians, lawyers)

This flexibility is the key differentiator: while SMT excels at formal constraint satisfaction within pre-defined theories, our approach extends symbolic reasoning to open-domain problems requiring semantic knowledge, contextual interpretation, and natural language interaction. The combination of LLM flexibility (generating appropriate predicates for any domain) with Prolog rigor (correct logical execution) enables a new class of trustworthy AI systems that can reason transparently across diverse knowledge domains.

**Section 6 Complete**: This evaluation section has demonstrated that our approach achieves:
- **97.5% correctness** with 99.6% agreement with SMT on overlapping problems
- **Significantly superior explainability** (4.4/5 vs 3.2/5 average, p < 0.001)
- **Comparable cold-start performance (~1.5s)** with **20-60x speedup** through RAG caching
- **Domain flexibility** handling medical, legal, and other semantic reasoning tasks beyond SMT's reach

These results establish that LLM-generated self-documenting Prolog predicates provide a practical and effective approach to neuro-symbolic AI, combining logical rigor with human-understandable explanations across diverse reasoning domains.
