- Conference: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Andreas_Neural_Module_Networks_CVPR_2016_paper.html

**Summary:**
Introduces a procedure for constructing neural module networks that compose collections of jointly-trained neural "modules" into deep networks for question answering. The approach decomposes questions into linguistic substructures and uses these to dynamically instantiate modular networks with reusable components.

**How Our Approach Differs:**
- NMNs require pre-defined modules and explicit linguistic parsing
- Our approach learns compositional structure end-to-end without hand-crafted modules
- NMNs are limited to visual QA tasks; our framework generalizes across domains

**Limitations Addressed:**
- Dependency on hand-crafted module libraries
- Requires explicit syntactic parsing of questions
- Limited to specific task architectures

**Award:** NAACL 2016 Best Paper

**Summary:**
Describes dynamic neural module networks that use natural language strings to automatically assemble neural networks from composable modules. Parameters are learned jointly with network-assembly parameters via reinforcement learning, with only (world, question, answer) triples as supervision.

**How Our Approach Differs:**
- Dynamic NMNs still require predefined module types and RL for assembly
- Our framework uses formal symbolic reasoning rather than module composition
- We provide stronger guarantees through formal verification

**Limitations Addressed:**

**Summary:**
Recovers structural scene representation from images and program trace from questions, executing programs on scene representations for answers. Achieved 99.8% on CLEVR dataset. Demonstrates advantages of robust program execution on symbolic space with explainable reasoning.

**How Our Approach Differs:**
- Limited to visual QA; our framework is domain-general
- Symbolic programs are domain-specific; we use general formal logic
- No formal verification; we provide correctness guarantees

**Limitations Addressed:**
- Domain specificity to visual reasoning
- No integration with theorem provers
- Limited compositional reasoning beyond trained operations

**Summary:**
Diagnostic dataset with 100,000 rendered images and ~1M automatically-generated questions (853,000 unique). Tests range of visual reasoning abilities with minimal biases and detailed annotations describing reasoning requirements. Benchmark for neural-symbolic visual reasoning.

**How Our Approach Differs:**
- CLEVR is a benchmark; we provide methods

- Our framework extends beyond visual reasoning

**Limitations Addressed:**
- Synthetic data doesn't transfer to real images
- Limited reasoning complexity
- Domain-specific to visual QA

## Summary of Key Gaps Our Approach Addresses

1. **Integration Gap**: Most work focuses on either neural or symbolic separately; we provide tight integration
2. **Verification Gap**: Existing hybrid approaches lack formal verification guarantees
3. **Generalization Gap**: Domain-specific systems (visual QA, mathematics) don't generalize; we provide domain-agnostic framework
4. **Scalability Gap**: Differentiable programming and pure symbolic approaches don't scale; we balance both
5. **Automation Gap**: Theorem provers require extensive manual effort; we automate through neural guidance
6. **Correctness Gap**: LLM reasoning lacks guarantees; we provide formal verification
7. **Efficiency Gap**: Long CoT and test-time compute are expensive; our symbolic reasoning is efficient
8. **Interpretability Gap**: Neural reasoning is black-box; our formal proofs are interpretable
